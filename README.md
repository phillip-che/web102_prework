## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As I was developing the app, I encountered several small challenges due to my limited experience with JavaScript, particularly with manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). One challenge that gave me some difficulty was the task of looping through all the games, creating an element for each, and appending it to the DOM to display them on the website. I was not aware that in JavaScript, one could iterate through each object in the games object list using "for (let game of games)." I had to do a lot of self-study, but it was a very interesting experience, and I definitely learned a lot.
